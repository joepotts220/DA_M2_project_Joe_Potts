## Project dataset:  The dataset was downloaded from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) website covering the years from 1975 to 2021. The data set includes hurricanes, tropical storms and other storm types, and each hurricane can have multiple rows showing the differing measurements taken during a storms duration.
## Findings:  The data shows that there were 6 hurricanes before 2010 that showed lower pressure measuremnts and higher wind speeds than any hurricanes in the years following 2010.
## Summary:  From this analysis, the title question: "Have US hurricanes increased in intensity over time?" shows the intensity of hurricanes is not increasing over the time period of this dataset.
